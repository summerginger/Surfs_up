# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis
This project imported extract from sqlAlchemy to filter the month required for temperature trends of Oahu in June and December. 
### The purpose 
The purpose of this project is to provide temperature information for our client W. Avy to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
## results

The Three Key differences in weather between June and December:
1.	The maximum temperature in June and December is 85, 83 respectively.
2.	The minimum temperature in June and December is 64, 56 respectively.
3.	 The average temperature in June is 71, and December is 74. The standard deviation is more minor in June (3.26) than in December (3.75).


### Additional results
Our goal is to help the business with insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu. Therefore, two additional pieces of data could help analyze better. One is the precipitation table, which can show how dry and wet over the months. The other is the most active station, which can provide the highest number of temperature observations. 
Hope all success! And enjoy surfing!
